            <p>To avoid damage to the vehicle and injury to people nearby, follow these safety precautions when you change a tire.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Find a safe location and ensure the surface is flat, firm, and high-friction.</li>
                <li>
                    <p>Don't service the vehicle on a narrow shoulder, near oncoming traffic, or on soft terrain.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Don't place the tire jack over a grate or manhole cover.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Don't place supports such as wooden blocks under the tire jack. </p>
                </li>
            </ul>

                    <p>The Rivian Tire Service Kit should only be used for roadside emergencies to change a flat or damaged tire on a Rivian vehicle. <a href="../../customer-service/customer-service.htm">Contact Rivian</a> for other types of service or repair.</p>

                <li>
                    <p>The Rivian Tire Service Kit is designed to lift a Rivian vehicle using the vehicle jack points only. Don't lift any other vehicle or cargo using the Rivian Tire Service Kit.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="important">
            <p>Rivian recommends that the tire tread depth difference between the left and right tires on each axle not exceed <MadCap:snippetText src="../../../Resources/Snippets/imperial-metric.flsnp" MadCap:snippetVariables="measure.imperial-value:2/32,;measure.imperial-unit:in,;measure.metric-value:1.6,;measure.metric-unit:mm," /> maximum. If the difference exceeds the maximum, then you may be required to replace both tires on the same axle at the same time. Follow your local regulations for tread wear limits.</p>
            <p>Install only the tire brands and models recommended by Rivian. Use the same tire model on either axle. For optimal performance, use the same tire model on all four wheels.</p>
            <p>Failure to fulfill all of the aforementioned requirements may result in changes to vehicle ride, handling, traction, and range.</p>
