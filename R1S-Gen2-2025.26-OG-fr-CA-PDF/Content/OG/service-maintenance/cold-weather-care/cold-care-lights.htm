        <h1>Lights</h1>
        <p>Use warm water and a soft cloth to remove snow and ice from the lights on the outside of the vehicle. You can also use a commercial deicer according to the product instructions.</p>
        <div class="caution">
            <p>Wipe the lights gently. Ice scrapers, snow brooms, and dirt or debris below the snow or ice may scratch the lens surface.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="note">
            <p>When the lights are clean and dry, you can apply a ceramic or automotive hydrophobic coating to minimize ice buildup. Follow the product instructions. Coatings may impact lens opacity and light performance.</p>
