        <h1>Tire Rotation</h1>
        <p>Rivian recommends the following for vehicles with square fitments (same size wheels and tires in all positions):</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Rotate the tires every <MadCap:snippetText src="../../../Resources/Snippets/imperial-metric.flsnp" MadCap:snippetVariables="measure.imperial-value:7\,500,;measure.imperial-unit:mi,;measure.metric-value:12\,000,;measure.metric-unit:km," /> to ensure even tread wear and extend tire life.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Use a four-tire rotation to ensure that your spare tire (if equipped) is in excellent condition.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Move the rear tires to the same sides on the front. </li>
                    <li>Move the front tires to the opposite sides on the rear.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <div class="note">
            <p>Vehicles with staggered fitments (different front and rear tire sizes) can be rotated side-to-side (left-to-right) but not front-to-back. Side-to-side rotation can increase tread life by changing the direction of rotation for each tire and balancing shoulder wear.</p>

        <p MadCap:conditions="R1GuideSpecificConditions.OwnersGuide">When you rotate your tires, you can <a href="../tires/wheel-tire-swap.htm">update the vehicle</a> using the center display. </p>
        <p MadCap:conditions="R1GuideSpecificConditions.OwnersGuide">To extend the life of your tires, in addition to regular tire rotations:</p>
        <ul MadCap:conditions="R1GuideSpecificConditions.OwnersGuide">
            <li>
                <p>Keep tires inflated to recommended pressures.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Observe posted speed limits.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Limit fast starts, quick turns, and hard acceleration.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Reduce speed and increase following distance to avoid heavy braking.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Avoid hitting curbs, potholes, or objects in the road.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Don't overload the tires. See <a href="../../safety/tires-wheels/steps-determining-load-limit.htm">Steps for Determining the Correct Load Limit</a>.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Don't clean or contaminate tires with fluids that can cause damage.</p>
