        <h1>About Pet Comfort</h1>
        <p>Pet Comfort maintains the cabin temperature so that pets can remain safely and comfortably in your vehicle after you leave. It also disables the interior alarm sensors, which the pet could accidentally activate.</p>
        <p>When you close the door to leave, the center display shows the cabin temperature, setting, and information that your pet is comfortable. Passersby can view the center display and know that your pet is safe in your absence.</p>
