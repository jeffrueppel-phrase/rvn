        <h1>Rivian Mobile App</h1>
        <p>Use the Rivian mobile app to monitor Pet Comfort when you're away from your vehicle. The app displays the Pet Comfort screen with the current cabin temperature on your phone.</p>
        <p>Download the app from the App Store<sup>®</sup> or on Google Play<sup>®</sup>.</p>
        <p>When Pet Comfort is active, this affects the app as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Climate preconditioning isn't available.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Access to doors and openings is available, and you can vent the windows.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="KeepWithNext">The vehicle communicates Pet Comfort issues through the app, push notifications, and text messages.</p>
        <p class="KeepWithNext">If the vehicle detects an issue with its climate system or an extreme temperature for a period of time:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>When the app is open, it displays an alert.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>When the app is closed, you receive a text message or push notification about the issue if you have opted into one or both communication methods.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>If Pet Comfort is active and the vehicle battery is critically low, with <MadCap:snippetText src="../../../Resources/Snippets/imperial-metric.flsnp" MadCap:snippetVariables="measure.imperial-value:5,;measure.imperial-unit:mi,;measure.metric-value:8,;measure.metric-unit:km," /> or less of range available, you receive a push notification. </p>
