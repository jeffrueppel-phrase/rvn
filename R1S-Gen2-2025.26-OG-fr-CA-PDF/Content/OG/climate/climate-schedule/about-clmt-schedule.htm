        <h1>About Climate Schedules</h1>
        <p>When a Climate Schedule is active, the vehicle prepares the cabin climate conditions prior to the travel departure time on the days that you specify.</p>
        <p>Use the Climate Schedule panel on the center display or in the Rivian mobile app to create and manage schedules, and turn them on or off.</p>
        <div class="notes">
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>The vehicle must be in <b>P</b>&#160;(Park) to use a Climate Schedule. </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>If you set a Climate Schedule, and later cancel a planned drive or don't drive the vehicle for a long time, ensure that you turn off the schedule. If you don't turn off the Climate Schedule, the vehicle still sets the climate as scheduled. This results in one of the following:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>The vehicle loses range if it isn't plugged into a charger.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>The vehicle uses more energy from the grid if it's plugged into a charger.</p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
