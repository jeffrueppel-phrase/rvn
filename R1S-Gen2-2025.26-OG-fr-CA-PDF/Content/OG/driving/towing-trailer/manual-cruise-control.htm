        <h1>Manual Cruise Control</h1>
        <p class="KeepWithNext">Manual Cruise Control is only available when you're towing a trailer. Manual Cruise Control maintains a set speed and allows you to remove your foot from the accelerator pedal.</p>
        <div class="warning">
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>When Manual Cruise Control is engaged,  always monitor traffic and driving conditions, and be prepared to brake if needed. This feature, along with the speed engagement settings, is designed to support you, the driver, and doesn't replace your attention, judgment, and need to control the vehicle. </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Manual Cruise Control doesn't adjust the set speed according to the posted speed limits. It's your responsibility to adjust the set speed according to the posted speed limit. </p>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <p class="KeepWithNext" MadCap:conditions="R1PlatformConditions.R1Peregrine">To turn on Manual Cruise Control, pull the drive stalk toward you and then release. The vehicle chimes and then maintains the set speed. The set speed appears in a circle at the top of the driver display.</p>

        <p class="KeepWithNext" MadCap:conditions="R1PlatformConditions.R1Peregrine">To turn off Manual Cruise Control, push the drive stalk away from you and then release, or press the brake pedal.</p>
        <p>Manual Cruise Control disengages when you apply the Manual Trailer Brake or if a trailer sway event occurs. Press the brake pedal or the Manual Trailer Brake to slow down the vehicle.</p>

            <p>When Manual Cruise Control is engaged, always monitor traffic and driving conditions. Be prepared to press the brake or accelerator pedal if needed.</p>

                <li>
                    <p>If you drive uphill or downhill while using Manual Cruise Control, the vehicle may not maintain the set speed.</p>
