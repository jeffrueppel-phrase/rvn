        <p style="page-break-inside:avoid;">The Tire and Loading Information label on the driver-side door frame describes the load capacity for the vehicle with or without a trailer. Since trailer loads are transferred to the vehicle,  include the trailer and cargo weight to calculate the vehicle's cargo capacity. To determine the vehicle's correct load limit, see <a href="../../safety/tires-wheels/steps-determining-load-limit.htm">Steps for Determining the Correct Load Limit</a>.</p>
        <p>Rivian recommends a tongue weight that is approximately 10% of the total loaded trailer weight. </p>
