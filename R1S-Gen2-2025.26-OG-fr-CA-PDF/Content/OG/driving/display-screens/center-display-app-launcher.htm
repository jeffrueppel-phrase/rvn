        <h1>App Launcher</h1>
        <p>The app launcher is located at the bottom-center of the center display. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Choose any app in the tray or expanded menu to launch it.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Swipe the app tray handle up or down to show or hide the expanded app menu. You can also tap the area above the expanded app menu to collapse it.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="KeepWithNext">For quick access to your favorites, you can customize which apps appear in the tray, and in what order, by doing the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Press-and-hold a favorite  in the app tray and drag it to another slot to reorder. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>From the expanded app menu, press-and-hold an app and drag it down to one of the slots in the app tray to replace an existing favorite. </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>With the expanded app menu exposed, you can drag a favorite app from the tray up to the expanded menu to reduce the number of favorite slots.</p>
        <div class="notes">
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>The vehicle must be in <b>P</b> (Park) for you to change the app ordering.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>The right-most app in the tray is your most recently used app that isn't already saved as a favorite.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>New apps appear in the expanded app menu with a dot next to them.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
