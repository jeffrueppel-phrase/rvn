        <div class="danger-nonelectrical">
            <p>To maintain stability and reduce the risk of a rollover, vehicle damage, or serious injury when driving on hills:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Proceed as slowly as possible yet as fast as necessary.</p>

            <p>To prevent vehicle damage and avoid getting stuck when negotiating obstacles:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Proceed as slowly as possible yet as fast as necessary.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Avoid driving over large obstacles centered under the vehicle.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Reduce your speed slightly when approaching the crest of a hill or the bottom of a dip while maintaining sufficient momentum to proceed.</p>

        <h2>Before You Begin</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>When negotiating obstacles for the first few times, start slowly to gain confidence. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Practice on smaller obstacles until you feel comfortable with the proper techniques and necessary speeds. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Don't be afraid to approach slowly. If you come to a stop and don't ground or excessively jolt the vehicle, you should be able to reverse and try again using slightly more speed or a slightly different approach angle. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Ensure during these early attempts that you either negotiate obstacles where you are unlikely to get stuck or that you have the equipment to <a href="recover-extract-vehicle.htm">recover the vehicle</a>.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>For optimal comfort and vehicle capability, use Standard or High ride height. Use Highest only in areas where extra clearance is needed.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2 class="KeepWithNext">Ruts and Tracks</h2>
        <ul style="page-break-inside:avoid;">
            <li>
                <p>Use a smooth driving technique to reduce jolts in rough tracks.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Follow existing tire tracks on wet, muddy, or hard ground since they offer the most traction and best chance of successful navigation. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Avoid existing tire tracks on soft, dry terrain where wheel sinkage occurs, such as sand, since thin, wind&#8209;dried crust breaks easily to expose the soft  sand underneath.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>If possible, straddle deep ruts where the bottom of the vehicle is likely to contact the ground. This reduces the chance of becoming grounded, in which multiple wheels no longer have traction. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>As you approach the crest of hills and the bottom of dips, reduce your speed slightly to prevent damage to the vehicle while maintaining sufficient momentum to avoid getting stuck. Proceed as slowly as possible yet as fast as necessary.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Steer carefully in slippery ruts since steering can have a reduced effect.  It can be helpful to periodically reduce your grip on the steering wheel to ensure the wheels are centered. You can also check the steering direction in <b>Drive Modes &gt; Gauge View</b> on the center display.</p>
                <div class="danger-nonelectrical">
                    <p>If the steering direction is not in your intended direction of travel, the vehicle could suddenly veer out of ruts when the depth decreases, flat ground is reached, or traction improves. Steer carefully to reduce the risk of a rollover, vehicle damage, or serious injury.</p>
                </div>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Ridges, Ditches, Steps, and Rocks</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Drive diagonally over small obstacles (where the underbody or bumpers won't touch the ground). You can take small obstacles slowly at right angles; however, it may cause a jolt.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Drive diagonally over medium-sized obstacles (where the vehicle may touch the ground) to prevent damage to the vehicle.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Drive with extreme caution over large obstacles (where the wheels leave the ground if driven diagonally). Maintain enough momentum to enable the vehicle to continue over the obstacle when you experience loss of traction. </p>
                <div class="important">
                    <p>It is critical to proceed as slowly as possible yet as fast as necessary.</p>
                </div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Choose a route that allows you to place a tire over a large obstacle. Choose an approach that allows you to maintain clearance and keep at least three wheels on the ground to push the vehicle forward.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2 class="KeepWithNext">Climbs and Descents</h2>
        <ul style="page-break-inside:avoid;">
            <li>
                <p>Approach and climb hills straight up. Use only enough speed to climb the hill and be able to control the vehicle over the crest. Press the accelerator pedal gently to reduce the likelihood of wheel spin.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>On more extreme climbs and descents, and where possible, get out and look at the slope to identify the traction conditions and obstacles ahead. This is particularly important before a descent as you will be unable to see over the hood as you drive over the crest.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Don't be afraid to tackle the hill slowly and repeat the approach with  increased speed until you complete the climb. This allows you to better understand what speeds are suitable when you climb hills in the future.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>A climb is likely to fail when the speed is insufficient or wheel spin slows the vehicle. As soon as you feel like you won't make it, press the brake pedal to stop the vehicle. Put the vehicle in <b>R</b> (Reverse) and keep both hands on the steering wheel. Use the side mirrors and the rearview mirror for rear vision. Avoid turning your head to look behind as this can cause you to turn the steering wheel. </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>If Hold is off, slowly ease off the brake pedal until the vehicle starts to move backwards. Maintain enough brake pressure to prevent the vehicle from gaining too much speed. On shallower gradients, regen may help to control the descent speed. If the vehicle begins to slide, ease off the brake pedal and gently press the accelerator pedal to match the wheel speed with the vehicle speed. Be ready to press the brake pedal again as the gradient decreases. </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>If Hold is on, slowly ease off the brake pedal, and then gently press the accelerator pedal  until the vehicle starts to move backwards. If the wheels start to slip, increase the accelerator pedal pressure to match the wheel speed with the vehicle speed. If the vehicle starts to speed up too much when there is traction, press the brake pedal to reduce speed.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Descend hills straight down and keep both hands on the steering wheel. For shallower descents, regen may help to control the vehicle speed. If the speed increases too much, then gradually press the brake pedal to reduce or maintain speed. As with a failed climb, if the wheels begin to slip and the vehicle starts sliding, be ready to press the accelerator pedal gradually to help the wheels catch up with the vehicle speed.</p>
