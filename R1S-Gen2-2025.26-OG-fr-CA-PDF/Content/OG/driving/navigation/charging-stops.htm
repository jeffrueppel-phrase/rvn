        <h1>Charging Stops</h1>
        <p> You can toggle to hide or show charging stations by choosing <b>Charging Stations</b> <MadCap:snippetText class="image-online-inline" src="../../../Resources/Images/Icons/inline/energy/ic_energy_charging_20_unselected.flsnp" /><img class="image-print-inline" MadCap:conditions="OutputTypeConditions.Print-all" src="../../../Resources/Images/Icons/inline/energy/ic_energy_charging_20_unselected.svg" /><img src="../../../Resources/Images/Icons/print/ui-icons-nav-charging-station-inline-print.svg" alt="charging station button" class="icon-in-line" MadCap:conditions="OutputTypeConditions.Print-all" /> to the right of the map on the center display. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>View information about a charging station by choosing a charger pin. Information includes type of station, location, distance, speed, and availability (if the station provides this status), as well as a charging score. These charging scores, based on plug-in data gathered from Rivian vehicles that visit the site, range from A to F, with A indicating the most reliable. Go to <b>Details</b> in the charging station dialog for more information about the station and its score.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Customize your view of charging  stations on the map with the filter buttons at the top for Speed, Network, and chargers to hide (for example, out-of-order sites, charging stations incompatible with Rivian vehicles, or those that need charging adapters).</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>If your vehicle doesn't have enough charge to reach a destination, charging stops are added to your trip to ensure sufficient range.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Choose <b>Trip Details</b> <MadCap:snippetText class="image-online-inline" src="../../../Resources/Images/Icons/inline/arrows/ic_arrows_caret_20_unselected_up.flsnp" /><img class="image-print-inline" MadCap:conditions="OutputTypeConditions.Print-all" src="../../../Resources/Images/Icons/inline/arrows/ic_arrows_caret_20_unselected_up.svg" /><img src="../../../Resources/Images/Icons/print/ui-icons-nav-tripdetails-inline-print.svg" alt="up chevron button" class="icon-in-line" MadCap:conditions="OutputTypeConditions.Print-all" /> to view Trip Details such as recommended charge times and charge speed. Choose a charging site to see more details. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Choose <b>Go</b> to begin navigation.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>If you prefer not to charge at the charging stops, choose <b>Remove Charging Stops</b> on the Trip Details panel. This removes all charging stops from your route.</p>

                <li>
                    <p>Battery range estimate for a route is based on your vehicle configuration, selected drive mode, and the route conditions (such as elevation, weather, and your driving speed).</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>As you navigate to a charging stop along a selected route,  the vehicle may heat or cool the battery pack to ensure that it reaches its most optimal charging temperature by the time you arrive at the stop. This helps facilitate the fastest possible charge time. When this occurs, you will see a  message on the Navigation screen and on the driver display.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Charging stations that need adapters are indicated on screens such as the navigation map, search results, and Trip Details. Not all models of NACS charging stations are compatible with Rivian vehicles. </p>
