        <h1>Park Assist</h1>
        <p>Park Assist is a low-speed feature that assists with reverse and parking maneuvers. Ultrasonic sensors measure distances around the vehicle. When you shift to <b>D</b> (Drive), the front camera view for the <a href="../introduction/sensors-and-cameras.htm">automatic cameras</a> appears on the center display when an object is detected in front of your vehicle, or as you pull into a parking spot. The feature provides a warning on the driver display and an audible warning if an object is too close to the vehicle.</p>
        <p class="KeepWithNext">The sensors can measure the following ranges around the vehicle:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Front or rear up to 
				<MadCap:snippetText src="../../../Resources/Snippets/imperial-metric.flsnp" MadCap:snippetVariables="measure.imperial-value:57,;measure.imperial-unit:in,;measure.metric-value:1.45,;measure.metric-unit:m," /></p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p> Sides up to <MadCap:snippetText src="../../../Resources/Snippets/imperial-metric.flsnp" MadCap:snippetVariables="measure.imperial-value:29,;measure.imperial-unit:in,;measure.metric-value:0.75,;measure.metric-unit:m," /></p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="KeepWithNext">The system displays warnings for objects detected within the sensor range as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>When you shift from <b>P</b> (Park) or <b>N</b> (Neutral) to <b>D</b> (Drive), Park Assist triggers only when an object is detected in the front of the vehicle at a distance of approximately <MadCap:snippetText src="../../../Resources/Snippets/imperial-metric.flsnp" MadCap:snippetVariables="measure.imperial-value:30,;measure.imperial-unit:in,;measure.metric-value:0.75,;measure.metric-unit:m," />.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>When you shift into <b>R</b> (Reverse), the driver display shows a top down view of the vehicle and warnings are provided for objects detected in the sensor range.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Park Assist provides audible warnings for objects that are detected in the vehicle path.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>When in <b>D</b> (Drive), chime warnings are only provided for objects detected in front of the vehicle and the front sides of the vehicle.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>When in <b>R</b> (Reverse), chime warnings are only provided for objects detected behind  the vehicle and the rear sides of the vehicle. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Park Assist provides warnings for objects detected on the sides only when the vehicle is moving.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>When an object is first detected in the vehicle's path, the system will chime once. As the object moves closer, the frequency of the chime increases. When the object is detected at the closest distance, the system provides a continuous chime.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Park Assist will not chime when the vehicle is traveling at a speed less than <MadCap:snippetText src="../../../Resources/Snippets/imperial-metric.flsnp" MadCap:snippetVariables="measure.imperial-value:1,;measure.imperial-unit:mph,;measure.metric-value:1,;measure.metric-unit:km/h," />.<br /></p>

            <li>
                <p>If you open any of the cabin doors, it disables the visual and chime warnings for the sides of the vehicle. </p>

            <li>
                <p>If you open the tailgate, it disables the visual and chime warnings for the rear and sides of the vehicle.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>If the vehicle remains stationary for approximately 10 seconds, the side warnings will go away.</p>

                        <p> Park Assist is not a substitute for careful and attentive driving. Don't depend on Park Assist alone to determine whether there is an approaching vehicle or if the area is free of people and objects. Visually check that there are no children, pedestrians, bicycles, animals, or objects present in your blind spots. Depending on Park Assist alone can result in serious injury or damage to the vehicle.</p>
