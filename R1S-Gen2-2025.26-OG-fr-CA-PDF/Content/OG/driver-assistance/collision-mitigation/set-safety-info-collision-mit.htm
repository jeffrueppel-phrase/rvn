        <h1>Settings and Safety Information</h1>
        <p>Collision mitigation features include Forward Collision Warning, Automatic Emergency Braking, and Dynamic Brake Support. These features warn you of potential frontal collisions and apply the brakes in attempt to prevent an imminent collision if you don't react in time.</p>
        <div class="important">
            <p>
                Keep the windshield, headlamps, front camera, and front radar in good condition and clear of any obstructions. Automatic Emergency Braking may not detect people or cars ahead if the front camera or front radar sensors are blocked or malfunctioning.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="warning">
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Forward Collision Warning, Automatic Emergency Braking, and Dynamic Brake Support are features designed to support the driver and don't replace the driver's attention, judgment, and need to control the vehicle.</p>

                <li>
                    <p>Forward Collision Warning and Automatic Emergency Braking may unexpectedly alert the driver and/or apply braking as a response to certain traffic conditions such as road debris, traffic signs, overhead passes, guardrails, bridges, tunnels, metal plates on the road, and other non-moving objects. In these scenarios, if it is safe to do so, the driver can press the accelerator pedal firmly to override the Automatic Emergency Braking.</p>
