        <h1>Curve Speed Assist</h1>
        <p>Curve Speed Assist (CSA) provides additional safety and comfort to Adaptive Cruise Control and Highway Assist when driving on curvy roads. Curve Speed Assist adjusts the vehicle's speed based on road curves and the driver's steering input.</p>
        <h2>Operating Conditions</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>You're not in an off-road drive mode or towing a trailer.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p class="KeepWithNext">You're traveling within the activation speed range: <MadCap:snippetText src="../../../Resources/Snippets/imperial-metric.flsnp" MadCap:snippetVariables="measure.imperial-value:20&#160;to&#160;85,;measure.imperial-unit:mph,;measure.metric-value:32&#160;to&#160;136,;measure.metric-unit:km/h," />.<br /></p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Engage Curve Speed Assist</h2>
        <p>Chevrons appear in front of the vehicle graphic on the driver display to indicate that Curve Speed Assist is engaged, and that your vehicle is slowing down.</p>
        <div class="note">
            <p>Curve Speed Assist operates only when Adaptive Cruise Control is on and not during manual driving.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="warning">
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>In certain conditions such as a high-speed approach to a curve or a road with sharp curves, Curve Speed Assist may not reduce speed sufficiently. Don't rely solely on Curve Speed Assist to control the vehicle.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Curve Speed Assist doesn't monitor posted speed limits.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                Curve Speed Assist is designed to support the driver and doesn't replace the driver's attention, judgment, and need to control the vehicle.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
