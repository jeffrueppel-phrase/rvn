        <h1>Smart Turn Signals</h1>
        <p>Smart Turn Signals automatically turns off the continuous turn signals after you complete a manual lane change on highways and settle in the new lane.</p>
        <div class="notes">
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>If you're unable to complete a lane change within 20 seconds of initiating the turn signals, Smart Turn Signals automatically turns off the signals.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>If you activate the turn signals by lightly pushing the stalk up or down, they automatically turn off after three flashes, regardless of whether a lane change is complete.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>If lane markings aren't clear, Smart Turn Signals may not turn off the signals. To manually turn off the turn signals, push the stalk in the opposite direction as the intended turn signal:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>Up for a right turn</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Down for a left turn</p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
