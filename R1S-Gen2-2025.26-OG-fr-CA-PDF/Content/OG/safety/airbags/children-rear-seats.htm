            </a>Children in Rear Seats</h1>
        <p>Although your vehicle is equipped with an  Occupant Classification System (OCS), both the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and Rivian highly recommend that all children 12 years old and younger be properly restrained in a rear seat. Doing so reduces the risk of injury or death caused by an inflating airbag to a child seated in the front passenger seat.</p>
        <p>It is illegal in many jurisdictions to let a child sit in the front passenger seat. If seating a child in the front passenger seat is legal in your jurisdiction, it is the driver's responsibility to ensure that the front passenger airbag is deactivated. When deactivated, the Passenger Airbag Off indicator turns on (illuminates). Failure to do so can result in serious injury or death to the child.</p>
        <p>If you have installed a child restraint in the front passenger seat, and the Passenger Airbag Off indicator  is turned off (not illuminated), remove and reinstall the child restraint from the seat following the  manufacturer's instructions. Failure to do so can result in serious injury or death to the child.</p>

                    <p>Never place a rear-facing child seat in front of an active airbag. Doing so can result in serious injury or death to the child. The safest place for children 12 years old and under in is the rear seats in a suitable child restraint.</p>
