        <h1>About Airbags</h1>
        <p>This vehicle is equipped with  supplemental restraint system (SRS) airbags, designed to help protect the driver and passengers from injuries. The airbags supplement the crash protection provided by correctly fastened seat belts. The vehicle is equipped with airbags and shoulder and lap seat belts for the driver and passengers. </p>
        <p>The supplemental airbags are not a substitute for wearing <a href="../seat-safety/seat-belts.htm">seat belts</a>.  All occupants, including the driver, should wear their seat belts. Failure to use seat belts increases the risk of severe injury or death in the event of a crash.</p>
        <p>The airbags don't require routine maintenance. If it is necessary to modify the airbag system for a person with disabilities, <a href="../../customer-service/customer-service.htm">contact Rivian</a>. The modification may affect the function of the advanced airbag system.</p>
        <h2>How Airbags Work</h2>
        <p>The airbag system sensors predict the severity of a crash when the crash conditions reach a certain threshold. When the threshold is reached, the specific restraints will deploy. If there is significant vehicle deceleration, the airbags deploy instantly with a loud sound. </p>
        <p>Not all collisions deploy the airbags. For example, certain low severity collisions and rear collisions don't deploy the airbags. </p>
        <p>The front passenger seat has an <a href="front-passenger-airbag-about.htm">Occupant Classification System</a> that determines whether the seat is occupied. Under certain conditions, it deactivates the&#160;airbag.</p>
