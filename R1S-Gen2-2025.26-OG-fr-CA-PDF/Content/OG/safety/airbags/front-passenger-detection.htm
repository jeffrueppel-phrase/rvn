        <h1>Occupancy Detection</h1>
        <p>To ensure that the Occupant Classification System (OCS) is properly classifying the front seat occupant, the occupant must:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Sit upright on the center of the seat cushion, with shoulders and back resting against the seat back, and with legs comfortably extended on the floor.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Remain seated on the center of the seat cushion for the duration of the trip.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>The OCS may not classify the front seat occupant properly if the occupant does any of the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Fails to sit in an upright position.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Leans against the door or center console.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Sits toward the front edge of the seat.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Puts their legs and feet on the dashboard.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Pulls the seat belt all the way out activating the Automatic Locking Retractor (ALR).</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>If an occupant of adult size is sitting in the front passenger seat, but the Passenger Airbag Off indicator on the center display is turned on (illuminated), it is possible that the occupant is not sitting properly in the seat. If this happens:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Have the occupant sit upright on the center of the seat cushion, with shoulders and back resting against the seat back, and with legs comfortably extended on the floor.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>It takes approximately 8&#160;seconds after sitting in the seat for the OCS to accurately report the status of the front passenger airbag on the center display. After 8 seconds, if the airbag status is still incorrect, instruct your passenger to sit properly in the rear seats. Do not allow an occupant to sit in the front passenger seat. <a href="../../customer-service/customer-service.htm">Contact Rivian</a> immediately to have the airbag system checked.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Certain conditions can also interfere with the accuracy of the OCS. To ensure that the OCS is properly classifying the front seat occupant, eliminate the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Objects under the seat.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Heavy objects placed on the seat (luggage, briefcase, large purse, or groceries).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Objects wedged between the seat back and seat cushion.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Objects wedged between the seat cushion and center console.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Heavy objects on the occupant's lap.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Car seat accessories like seat covers, cushions, heavy blankets, or massagers on the seat structure.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>These conditions can interfere with the OCS. If you have eliminated the above conditions, and the airbag status is still incorrect, instruct your passenger to sit properly in the rear seats. Do not allow an occupant to sit in the front passenger seat. <a href="../../customer-service/customer-service.htm">Contact Rivian</a> immediately to have the airbag system checked.</p>
