            </a>Proper Sitting Position</h1>
        <p>It is critical that vehicle occupants sit properly in their seat. Occupants should sit upright on the center of the seat cushion, with their shoulders and back resting against the seat back, and with their legs comfortably extended on the floor. Follow the proper seating instructions below. Failure to do so can result in serious injury or death.</p>
        <p>
            <b>Correct</b>

        </p>
        <p>Sitting improperly can increase the risk of injury or death, even in low-speed collisions. For example, if an occupant sits out of position on the front edge of the seat cushion, turns sideways, or puts one or two feet on the dashboard, the chance of injury during a crash greatly increases.</p>

                    <p>The status of the front passenger airbag is shown by the indicator light located on the center display. If the airbag status is incorrect, instruct your passenger to sit properly in the rear seats. Do not allow an occupant to sit in the front passenger seat. <a href="../../customer-service/customer-service.htm">Contact Rivian</a> immediately to have the airbag system checked. Failure to do so can result in serious injury or death to the occupant.</p>
