        <p class="KeepWithNext">All child restraint systems are designed to be secured in vehicle seats by the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Lap belts</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Lap belt portion of a lap-shoulder belt</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Lower and tether anchorages (LATCH/ISOFIX)</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <div class="danger-nonelectrical">
            <ul>
                <li MadCap:conditions="RegionSpecificConditions.CA">
                    <p>Infants and small children should be seated in an approved and appropriate child seat at all times while the vehicle is in motion.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Properly secure the child seat before the vehicle is in motion, even if the&#160;child seat is unoccupied, because an unsecured child seat can injure&#160;passengers. </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Don't install a child seat in any of the front seats to avoid serious injury and death to the child from the deployment of the airbags. According to accident statistics, children are safer when properly restrained in the rear seating positions than in the front seating positions. </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p> Properly secure child restraints in the vehicle to avoid endangering children in a crash.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Sunny weather can heat up the metal portion of the seat belts. Use caution when seating a child and touching seat belts in the vehicle.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="warning">
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>You can use your Rivian account (user profile) to automatically move the driver seat to a desired position. However, ensure that the front seats are a safe and comfortable distance from a child seat or a child sitting directly behind them in the second row.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Don't dress children in bulky clothing when seating them in child seats since this may reduce the effectiveness of the restraint system.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p style="word-spacing:-1.5px;">Don't leave children unattended, even if they are secured in a child seat.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Don't use a child seat that has been involved in a collision, even if it doesn't show any sign of damage. </p>
