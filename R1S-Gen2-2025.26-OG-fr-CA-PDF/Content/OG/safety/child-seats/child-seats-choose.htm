        <h1>Choose a Child Seat</h1>
        <p MadCap:conditions="RegionSpecificConditions.CA" style="page-break-inside:avoid;">Children should sit in the rear seats, properly restrained in child or booster seats appropriate for their height and weight. Use a child seat that meets the Canadian Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (CMVSS) and is appropriate for the child's age, height, and weight. Also check child seat usage recommendations with the laws of your province or territory, and Transport Canada. Compliance documentation can either be found on a sticker affixed to the child seat or in the instructions included with the seat. Follow the manufacturer's instructions when installing a child seat in the vehicle. Before you purchase a child seat, determine if the seat is compatible with your vehicle. </p>
