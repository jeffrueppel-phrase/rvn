        <h1>Uniform Tire Quality Grading</h1>
        <p>
            <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="RegulatoryConditions.HomologatedContent">Quality grades can be found where applicable on the tire sidewall between tread shoulder and maximum section width. For example: Treadwear 200 Traction AA Temperature A.</MadCap:conditionalText>
        </p>
        <h3 MadCap:conditions="RegulatoryConditions.HomologatedContent">Treadwear</h3>
        <p MadCap:conditions="RegulatoryConditions.HomologatedContent">The treadwear grade is a comparative rating based on the wear rate of the tire when tested under controlled conditions on a specified government test course. For example, a tire graded 150 would wear under one-and-a-half (1-1/2) times as well on the government course as a tire graded 100. The relative performance of tires depends upon the actual conditions of their use, however, and may depart significantly from the norm due to variations in driving habits, service practices and differences in road characteristics and&#160;climate.</p>
        <h3 MadCap:conditions="RegulatoryConditions.HomologatedContent">Traction – AA, A, B, and C</h3>
        <p MadCap:conditions="RegulatoryConditions.HomologatedContent">The traction grades from highest to lowest are AA, A, B, and C and they represent the tire's&#160;ability to stop on wet pavement as measured under controlled conditions on specified&#160;government test surfaces of asphalt and concrete. Tires marked C may have poor traction&#160;performance.</p>
        <div class="warning" MadCap:conditions="R1GuideSpecificConditions.OwnersGuide">
            <p MadCap:conditions="RegulatoryConditions.HomologatedContent">The traction grade assigned to this tire is based on braking (straight ahead) traction tests and does not include cornering (turning) traction.</p>
        </div>
        <h3 MadCap:conditions="RegulatoryConditions.HomologatedContent">Temperature – A, B, and C</h3>
        <p MadCap:conditions="RegulatoryConditions.HomologatedContent">The temperature grades are A (the highest), B, and C, representing the tire's resistance to the generation of heat and its ability to dissipate heat when tested under controlled conditions on a specified indoor laboratory test wheel. Sustained high temperature can cause the material of the tire to degenerate and reduce tire life, and excessive temperature can lead to sudden tire failure. </p>
        <p MadCap:conditions="RegulatoryConditions.HomologatedContent">The grade C corresponds to a level of performance which all passenger car tires must meet under the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard No. 109. Grades A and B represent&#160;higher levels of performance on the laboratory test wheel than the minimum required&#160;by&#160;law.</p>
        <div class="warning">
            <p MadCap:conditions="RegulatoryConditions.HomologatedContent">The temperature grade for this tire is established for a tire that is properly inflated and not overloaded. Excessive speed, under-inflation, or excessive loading, either separately or in combination, can cause heat buildup and possible tire failure.</p>
