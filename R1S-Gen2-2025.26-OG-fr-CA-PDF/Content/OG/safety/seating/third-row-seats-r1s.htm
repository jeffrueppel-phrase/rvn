        <h2>Access the Seats</h2>
        <p>To access the third-row seats, press the second-row seat walk-in switch. The seat tilts at a 45-degree&#160;angle and slides forward. To return the second-row seat to its original position, slide the seat back on the track and push the seat back up until it locks into place.</p>
        <div class="warning  alert-padding">
            <p>Ensure that the second-row seat locks into place so that it doesn't shift while the vehicle is in motion. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="note">
            <p>The walk-in switch doesn't work when the vehicle is in <b>D</b> (Drive), <br MadCap:conditions="OutputTypeConditions.Print-8x11,LanguageConditions.fr" /><b>R</b> (Reverse), or has an occupant.</p>
