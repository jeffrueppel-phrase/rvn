        <h1>Vehicle Leveling</h1>
        <p>You can level your vehicle when parked on uneven terrain.</p>
        <h2>Level the Vehicle</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Find an appropriate parking spot.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Park your vehicle.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Clear the area surrounding your vehicle.</p>
                <div class="important">
                    <p>Ensure you have clearance above and below your vehicle to raise or lower its ride height.</p>
                </div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Close all doors.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Choose <b>Level</b> on the center display.  The vehicle checks whether it can safely level itself on the surrounding terrain.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p> If the terrain is suitable, the vehicle levels itself. This may take several minutes.</p>
                        <div class="notes">
                            <ul>

                                    <p>Remain seated until the vehicle finishes leveling itself.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>The vehicle may make sounds while the air suspension adjusts to level the vehicle.</p>
                                </li>
                            </ul>

                    <li>
                        <p>If the terrain isn't suitable, the vehicle notifies you to find suitable terrain. After you move and park your vehicle, you can choose <b>Level</b> again.<br></br></p>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <li>
                    <p>If you briefly open a door, the vehicle pauses its leveling. After you close the door, the vehicle resumes its leveling.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>If you open a door and it remains open for a long time, the vehicle stops leveling. To level the vehicle, choose <b>Reset ride height</b> and then choose <b>Level</b>.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>If the leveled vehicle is parked for a long time, the vehicle may droop over time. To level the vehicle, choose <b>Reset ride height</b> and then choose <b>Level</b>.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <h2 class="KeepWithNext">Reset Ride Height</h2>
        <p class="KeepWithNext">To return the vehicle to its previous ride height, choose <b>Reset ride height</b> or drive the vehicle.</p>

                <li>
                    <p>The vehicle may make sounds while the air suspension adjusts to reset to the previous ride height.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>If you drive the vehicle after it is leveled, its handling, driving performance, and speed are limited until the vehicle automatically returns to its previous ride height.</p>
