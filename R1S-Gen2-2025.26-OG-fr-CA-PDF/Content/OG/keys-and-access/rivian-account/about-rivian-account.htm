        <h1>About Rivian Accounts and Keys</h1>
        <p>Key types include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Phone keys - Rivian mobile app keys</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Key fobs - Physical key fobs</p>
            </li>
            <li MadCap:conditions="R1PlatformConditions.R1Peregrine">
                <p>Key cards - Physical key cards</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>To understand how vehicles and keys work with Rivian accounts and IDs:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p class="KeepWithNext">All vehicle drivers must have a Rivian account. When you set up a Rivian account either through the Rivian mobile app or in a web browser, the account assigns a Rivian ID. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p class="KeepWithNext">Each vehicle allows one driver to identify as the primary owner, and any others to identify as drivers. </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b>Primary owner:</b> The primary owner has all administrator rights.</li>
                    <li MadCap:conditions="R1PlatformConditions.R1Peregrine">
                        <p>
                            <b>Driver:</b> Drivers have no administrator rights. They can access and drive the vehicle if they have an assigned physical key, or if they've  set up a phone key.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>For phone keys, the owner and any added drivers can set up their phone as a key as long as they are logged into the Rivian app and are associated with a vehicle.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Owners can add additional physical keys and assign them to other drivers, which associate the driver's Rivian account and ID to the assigned key.</p>
            </li>
            <li>The vehicle uses the key to identify and authorize a driver.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The Rivian ID&#160;also saves driver preference information, such as seat position, in the <a href="../../driving/basic-operations/driver-profile-settings/driver-profile-seat.htm">Driver Profile</a>.</p>
        <div class="notes">
            <ul>
                <li MadCap:conditions="R1PlatformConditions.R1Peregrine">
                    <p>If the owner revokes a driver's access, all phone keys associated with that driver are deleted and any assigned physical keys are reassigned to the owner.</p>
                </li>
