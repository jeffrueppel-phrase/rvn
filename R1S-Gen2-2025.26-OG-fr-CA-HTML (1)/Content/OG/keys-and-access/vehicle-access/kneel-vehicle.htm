        <h1>Kneel Vehicle</h1>
        <p MadCap:conditions="R1PlatformConditions.R1Peregrine">When the vehicle is at the Standard ride height, and in All-Purpose or Snow drive mode, use the Kneel vehicle upon parking setting to make it easier to get in and out of the car. With this setting turned on, the vehicle lowers when shifted into <b>P</b> (Park), regardless of the <a href="../../driving/drive-modes/ride-height.htm#AutoRideHeightChanges">Auto ride height</a> setting. </p>
        <p>Kneel vehicle upon parking is disabled by default. To change this setting, and save it to your driver profile:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Choose <b>Settings <MadCap:snippetText class="image-online-inline" src="../../../Resources/Images/Icons/inline/misc/ic_misc_settings_20_unselected.flsnp" /><img class="image-inline-day" src="../../../Resources/Images/Icons/day/app-settings-on-inline-day.svg" alt="Settings icon" MadCap:conditions="OutputTypeConditions.Web" /><img src="../../../Resources/Images/Icons/night/app-settings-on-inline-night.svg" alt="Settings icon" class="image-inline-night" MadCap:conditions="OutputTypeConditions.Web" /> &gt; Vehicle &gt; Access</b> on the center display.  </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Choose <b>Kneel vehicle upon parking</b> to enable or disable it.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <div class="warning">
            <p>To prevent any injury or damage, ensure there is no person or any object(s) under the vehicle when Kneel vehicle upon parking is active.</p>
        </div>
        <p>Other Kneel features and behaviors:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Lowering pauses if one or more doors are opened before Kneel finishes, and resumes if all doors are closed within 60 seconds. If doors remain open longer than 60 seconds, Kneel cancels.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>During lowering to Kneel, press the right steering wheel thumb control button to cancel lowering and return to the previous ride height.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The vehicle automatically raises from Kneel and returns to its previous ride height after you start driving over <MadCap:snippetText src="../../../Resources/Snippets/imperial-metric.flsnp" MadCap:snippetVariables="measure.imperial-value:5,;measure.imperial-unit:mph,;measure.metric-value:8,;measure.metric-unit:km/h,"></MadCap:snippetText>. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>If you manually exit Kneel by changing ride heights or drive modes, Kneel re-engages the next time you drive over <MadCap:snippetText src="../../../Resources/Snippets/imperial-metric.flsnp" MadCap:snippetVariables="measure.imperial-value:5,;measure.imperial-unit:mph,;measure.metric-value:8,;measure.metric-unit:km/h," /> and shift into <b>P</b> (Park). </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The vehicle may not always lower to Kneel in certain conditions, such as a high air suspension compressor temperature. Once the air compressor cools, the vehicle lowers to Kneel the next time you drive over <MadCap:snippetText src="../../../Resources/Snippets/imperial-metric.flsnp" MadCap:snippetVariables="measure.imperial-value:5,;measure.imperial-unit:mph,;measure.metric-value:8,;measure.metric-unit:km/h," /> and shift into <b>P</b> (Park).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>When switching between driver profiles with different Kneel vehicle settings, the vehicle switches to the new setting the next time you drive over <MadCap:snippetText src="../../../Resources/Snippets/imperial-metric.flsnp" MadCap:snippetVariables="measure.imperial-value:5,;measure.imperial-unit:mph,;measure.metric-value:8,;measure.metric-unit:km/h," /> and shift into <b>P</b> (Park).</p>
