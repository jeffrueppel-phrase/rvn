        <h1>Multi-Factor Drive</h1>
        <p>Multi-factor Drive requires the key owner's approval prior to vehicle start. To enable this setting:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Log into the vehicle's primary owner account in the Rivian mobile app.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Go to <b>Security and access</b> and turn on <b>Multi-factor Drive</b>.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>To start the vehicle when Multi-factor Drive is turned on:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Unlock and enter the vehicle.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Press the brake. A notification appears on the driver display, and a request to approve the drive appears on the phone of the key owner. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The key owner approves the drive. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>After the driver display notification clears, start the vehicle.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>If the key owner does not receive the approval request on their phone, or if the notification on the driver display does not clear, do one of the following in the driver display notification:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Choose <b>Send it again</b> to resend the request to the phone.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Choose <b>Try another way</b>. This opens a keypad on the driver display requesting a time-sensitive passcode. If you don't know the code, and you are the key owner:</p>
                <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
                    <li>
                        <p>Choose <b>Where's my passcode</b> below the keypad.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Scan the QR code with your phone. The passcode appears on your phone.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Enter the passcode into the keypad.</p>
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>To turn off <b>Multi-factor Drive</b>, go to <b>Security and access</b> in the Rivian mobile app.</p>
        <div class="notes">
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p style="font-weight: normal;">Only the primary owner can turn Multi-factor Drive on and off. The setting applies to all drivers and keys associated with the vehicle.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p style="font-weight: normal;">To approve a drive, the key owner must have a Rivian account associated with the key, and the key must be paired with the vehicle.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>The key owner can also access the passcode from the <b>Security and access</b> screen in the Rivian mobile app. Choose <b>View time-based passcode</b>.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
