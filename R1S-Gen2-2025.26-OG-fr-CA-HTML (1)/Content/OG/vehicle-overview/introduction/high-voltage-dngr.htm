                <li>
                    <p>You could be electrocuted, seriously injured, or die if you attempt to perform your own service or repair on high&#8209;voltage systems.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Rivian vehicles contain lithium-ion battery packs, extremely high&#8209;voltage cables (400–450 V), electrical outlet cables (120 V), traditional car batteries (12 V), compressed gas, and triggering devices.  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>High-voltage components are identified by labels.  Don't remove, open, take apart, or modify these components.  High-voltage cable or wiring has an orange covering.  Don't probe, tamper with, cut, or modify high-voltage cables or wiring.  Always assume the vehicle is energized.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Rivian strongly recommends that you have all service and repair work done at a Rivian&#8209;authorized service center, mobile service vehicle, or repair facility.   </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Service and repair of high-voltage systems should only be performed by a trained technician with the proper knowledge and tools.  It is dangerous to perform your own service or repair work on high&#8209;voltage systems.  Exposure to high voltage can cause electrocution, severe injury, or death.</p>
