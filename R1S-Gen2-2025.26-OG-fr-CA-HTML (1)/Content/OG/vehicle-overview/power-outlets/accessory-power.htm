        <h1>Accessory Power</h1>
        <p>Accessory power allows you to keep your vehicle powered on even when you walk away from your vehicle, lock the car, or restart the vehicle. A visual indicator appears in the center of the status bar to alert you if the power is on.</p>
        <div class="note">
            <p>Using accessory power reduces your range.</p>
        </div>
        <p>The 12&#160;V and USB&#8209;C outlets, as well as the wireless charging pad, are always on when the vehicle is in use. Turn on <b>Outlets</b> to keep the power on when you are away from your vehicle.</p>
        <p>To send power to the 120&#160;V power outlets, 12&#160;V and USB&#8209;C outlets, and the wireless charging pad:</p>
