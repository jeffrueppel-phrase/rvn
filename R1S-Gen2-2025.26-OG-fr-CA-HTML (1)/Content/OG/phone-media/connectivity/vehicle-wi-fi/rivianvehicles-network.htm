        <h1 class="KeepWithNext">The RivianVehicles Network</h1>
        <p class="KeepWithNext">If your vehicle is near or at a Rivian facility, such as a service center or office, a Rivian-only network named "RivianVehicles" may appear on the list of available Wi-Fi networks. Your vehicle may automatically connect to this secure network.</p>
        <p class="KeepWithNext">Your vehicle connects to "RivianVehicles"&#160;under the following conditions:</p>
        <ul style="page-break-inside:avoid;">
            <li>
                <p>The vehicle's Wi-Fi is enabled.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The vehicle is near or at a Rivian facility.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The vehicle is within range of the "RivianVehicles"&#160;network. </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>You can manually connect your vehicle to "RivianVehicles" if your vehicle is currently connected to a different Wi-Fi network.</p>
