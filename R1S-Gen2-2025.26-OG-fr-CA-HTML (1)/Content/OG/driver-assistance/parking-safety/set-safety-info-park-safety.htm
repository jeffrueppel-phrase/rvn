        <h1>Settings and Safety Information</h1>
        <p>Parking safety features include Park Assist and Rear Cross-Traffic Warning. These features help you park your vehicle and back out of a parking spot by warning you of close objects and approaching cross traffic when you're in <span class="nonbreaking"><b>R</b>&#160;(Reverse)</span>.</p>
        <div class="warning">
            <p>Park Assist and Rear Cross-Traffic Warning are features designed to support the driver and don't replace the driver's attention, judgment, and need to control the vehicle.</p>
