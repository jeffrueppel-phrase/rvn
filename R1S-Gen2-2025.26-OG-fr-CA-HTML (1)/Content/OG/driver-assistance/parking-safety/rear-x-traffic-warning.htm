        <h1>Rear Cross-Traffic Warning</h1>
        <p>The Rear Cross-Traffic Warning provides a visual warning on the center and driver displays,  and provides an audible warning of vehicles approaching from the sides behind your vehicle. The feature activates when the vehicle is in <span class="nonbreaking"><b>R</b>&#160;(Reverse)</span> or rolling backward in <b>N</b> (Neutral).</p>
        <p>The system uses rear radar sensors to detect vehicles approaching from either side when backing out of a perpendicular or angled parking space.</p>

                The detection range for Rear Cross-Traffic Warning may vary, depending on the approaching vehicle's speed. </p>
