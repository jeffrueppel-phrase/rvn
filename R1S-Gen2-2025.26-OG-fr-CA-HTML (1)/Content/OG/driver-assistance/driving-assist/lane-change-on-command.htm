        <h1>Lane Change on Command</h1>
        <p>Lane Change on Command automatically performs lane changes at your request while Highway Assist is engaged. Lane Change on Command may bring the vehicle back to the original lane if the lane change can't be completed because of road or traffic conditions.</p>
        <h2>Operating Conditions</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Highway Assist is engaged.</p>
            </li>
            <li>You're traveling within the activation speed range: <MadCap:snippetText src="../../../Resources/Snippets/imperial-metric.flsnp" MadCap:snippetVariables="measure.imperial-value:50&#160;to&#160;85,;measure.imperial-unit:mph,;measure.metric-value:80&#160;to&#160;137,;measure.metric-unit:km/h," />.</li>
            <li>You can also use Lane Change on Command if you are traveling between <MadCap:snippetText src="../../../Resources/Snippets/imperial-metric.flsnp" MadCap:snippetVariables="measure.imperial-value:20&#160;to&#160;50,;measure.imperial-unit:mph,;measure.metric-value:32&#160;to&#160;80,;measure.metric-unit:km/h," />. In this case, a vehicle must be detected in the lane into which you want to move, and must be traveling at an appropriate distance and speed, for your vehicle to make the lane change.</li>
        </ul>
        <!-- LB note 6/4/25: to get notes on this page in French (fr-CA), add style="margin-top: -3pt;" to h2 below -->
        <h2>Engage Lane Change on Command</h2>
        <p>To request a lane change, turn on the turn signal in the intended direction of lane change by pushing the <a href="../../driving/basic-operations/stalks.htm">lights stalk</a> up or down to the second click.</p>
        <p>When Lane Change on Command starts performing the lane change, animations appear on the driver display to indicate the status of the lane change. After a lane change successfully completes, the turn signals automatically turn off.</p>
        <p>Lane Change on Command provides visual cues if the adjacent lane is blocked by a vehicle. In order to create the necessary gap, your vehicle may do the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Slow down, indicated by chevrons going toward the vehicle graphic on the driver display</p>
            </li>
            <!-- LB note 6/4/25: to get notes on this page in French (fr-CA), add style="margin-bottom: -10pt;" to p below -->
            <li>
                <p>Accelerate closer to the vehicle in front than the selected gap distance, indicated by chevrons going away from the vehicle graphic on the driver display</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>If the feature is unable to find a gap and complete the lane change in 30 seconds, the lane line in the driver display flashes red, and the vehicle chimes, indicating a timeout. If there is a large difference between your speed and that of vehicles in the target lane, the lane change request may also be rejected. You can request a new lane change after the timeout.</p>
        <p>When you request a lane change into a lane that isn't supported by the feature, such as mandatory exit, merge lane, or shoulder of the highway, the lane line in the driver display turns red momentarily, and the vehicle chimes.</p>
        <!-- LB note 6/4/25: to get notes on this page in French (fr-CA), add style="margin-top: -1pt;margin-bottom: -10pt;" to div below -->
        <div class="notes">
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>If you turn the steering wheel during the lane change, Lane Change on Command disengages, and the system switches to Highway Assist Reengage.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>While a lane change is in progress, if you turn off the turn signals or change the turn signal direction, the vehicle will either complete the lane change or return to the original lane depending on the vehicle's position during the lane change.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <h3>Exceed Set Speed Threshold</h3>
        <p>You have the option of allowing the vehicle to temporarily exceed your set speed for Highway Assist when performing a Lane Change on Command. When this feature is enabled, your vehicle may exceed the set speed by up to <MadCap:snippetText src="../../../Resources/Snippets/imperial-metric.flsnp" MadCap:snippetVariables="measure.imperial-value:5,;measure.imperial-unit:mph,;measure.metric-value:8,;measure.metric-unit:km/h," /> to find a gap in the adjacent lane. This option reduces the number of times that your vehicle attempts to change lanes behind a slow-moving vehicle in the target lane, allowing your vehicle to speed up and change lanes into a more probable gap.</p>
        <p>To toggle this option on or off, go to <b>Settings <MadCap:snippetText class="image-online-inline" src="../../../Resources/Images/Icons/inline/misc/ic_misc_settings_20_unselected.flsnp" /><img class="image-inline-day" src="../../../Resources/Images/Icons/day/app-settings-on-inline-day.svg" alt="Settings icon" MadCap:conditions="OutputTypeConditions.Web" style="font-weight: bold;" /><img src="../../../Resources/Images/Icons/night/app-settings-on-inline-night.svg" alt="Settings icon" class="image-inline-night" MadCap:conditions="OutputTypeConditions.Web" style="font-weight: bold;" /> &gt; Vehicle &gt; Driver Assistance &gt; Exceed set speed</b>. </p>
        <h2>Disengage Lane Change on Command</h2>
        <p>You can disengage Lane Change on Command in the following ways:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Disengage Highway Assist.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Turn the steering wheel while Lane Change on Command is engaged.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Toggle Lane Change on Command to "Off" in <b>Settings <MadCap:snippetText class="image-online-inline" src="../../../Resources/Images/Icons/inline/misc/ic_misc_settings_20_unselected.flsnp" /><img class="image-inline-day" src="../../../Resources/Images/Icons/day/app-settings-on-inline-day.svg" alt="Settings icon" MadCap:conditions="OutputTypeConditions.Web" style="font-weight: bold;" /><img src="../../../Resources/Images/Icons/night/app-settings-on-inline-night.svg" alt="Settings icon" class="image-inline-night" MadCap:conditions="OutputTypeConditions.Web" style="font-weight: bold;" /> &gt; Vehicle &gt; Driver Assistance</b>.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Lane Change on Command is designed to detect vehicles in adjacent lanes; however, it is your responsibility to visually check that the target lane is clear before you request a lane change.
</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Always monitor the surrounding areas, and be prepared to take over control of the vehicle at any time.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>There may be scenarios where the vehicle can neither complete the lane change nor return to the original lane.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Lane Change on Command may not slow down the vehicle quickly enough if the vehicle in front of you brakes aggressively.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p> Lane Change on Command may perform erroneous lane changes if clear lane lines are not visible. Scenarios include, but are not limited to, faded or missing lane lines, or lane lines covered by cones, barrels, other objects or debris.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Lane Change on Command may not work as expected when an accessory such as a trailer, bike rack, or cargo basket is attached to the tow hitch.</p>
