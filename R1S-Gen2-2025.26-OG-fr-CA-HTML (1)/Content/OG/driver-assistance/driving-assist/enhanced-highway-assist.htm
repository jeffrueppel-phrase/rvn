        <h1>Enhanced Highway Assist</h1>
        <p>Enhanced Highway Assist allows you to use Highway Assist while letting go of the steering wheel for extended periods, in certain driving situations, as long as you're looking at the road. Enhanced Highway Assist relies on driver attention detection to confirm that you're attentive to the road ahead of you.</p>
        <h2>Driver Attention Detection</h2>
        <p>Driver Attention Detection uses the interior camera to track head and eye movements and confirm your attention to the road, supporting driver assistance features such as Enhanced Highway Assist. Driver Attention Detection  processes interior camera images in-vehicle, and only certain data, such as  the detected direction of the driver's gaze, is recorded and shared with Rivian.</p>
        <p>Images and videos are not recorded or shared unless you allow data sharing for the interior camera. See "Driver Attention Detection" in <a href="../../legal-reference/data-and-privacy.htm">Data and Privacy</a>.</p>
        <p>Certain head and face coverings such as some sunglasses, hats, or other types of clothing that obscure facial or head features may interfere with system performance. To improve camera performance, do the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Ensure that the rearview mirror is clean and properly positioned.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Adjust your seating position as needed.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Remove any objects that cover your face or eyes.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Enhanced Highway Assist and Driver Attention Detection are on by default. You can update your selections in the <a href="set-safety-info-driving-asst.htm">Settings app</a> and the <a href="../../legal-reference/data-and-privacy.htm">Data and Privacy screen</a> on the center display.</p>

            <p>When Enhanced Highway Assist is engaged, you'll hear a chime  to prompt you to keep your hands on the steering wheel only in the following cases:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>You engaged Enhanced Highway Assist for the first time during a drive.</p>

                <li>
                    <p>You engaged Enhanced Highway Assist after a system takeover.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>If you don't engage Enhanced Highway Assist within 30&#160;seconds of feature availability, the hands stop flashing and turn translucent. Translucent hands indicate that Enhanced Highway Assist is still available.</p>

        <div class="warning">
            <p>Enhanced Highway Assist is designed to support the driver and doesn't replace the driver's attention, judgment, and need to control the vehicle. The feature will not prevent collisions in all situations.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Disengage Enhanced Highway Assist</h2>
        <p>Disengage Enhanced Highway Assist in one of the following ways:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Keep your eyes on the road and place your hands on the steering wheel to transition from Enhanced Highway Assist to Highway Assist.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Push the drive stalk away from you.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Press the brake pedal.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <div class="warning">
            <p>Enhanced Highway Assist may provide visual and audible cues prompting you to pay attention to the road ahead if it detects driver distraction, such as when your head and eyes are directed away from the road.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Driver Take Over Request</h2>
        <p>Enhanced Highway Assist may ask you to keep hands on the steering wheel by providing audible and visual notifications in the following cases:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>When you're approaching a construction zone, a high curvature, a road with unclear lane lines, or other driving or road situations where the system won't work.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>When one or more systems has degraded, preventing hands-free use.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>In some severe weather conditions.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <div class="note">
            <p>Placing your hands on the steering wheel while keeping your eyes on the road will disengage Enhanced Highway Assist and instead engage Highway Assist.</p>
        </div>
        <p>If you don't look at the road when prompted or don't take control of the vehicle within a certain period of time, Enhanced Highway Assist continues to provide warnings and starts decelerating the vehicle. During this time, you can either push the drive stalk away, or press the brake pedal to take full control of the vehicle. If you don't take control, Highway Assist brings the vehicle to a complete stop and then automatically turns on the hazard lights. Enhanced Highway Assist and Highway Assist then remain unavailable until you shift out of <b>P</b> (Park) to start a new drive cycle.</p>
