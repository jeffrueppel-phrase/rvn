        <h1>Settings and Safety Information</h1>
        <p>Lane safety features include Lane Departure Warning, Lane Keeping Assist, and Blind Spot Monitoring. These features use sensors and cameras on the side view mirrors and behind the rearview mirror  to help keep you safely centered in your lane and warn you of vehicles in your blind spot when you change lanes.</p>
        <div class="important">
            <p>Keep the windshield and area around the front camera in good condition and clear of any obstructions. Lane safety features may not detect an unintentional lane departure if the front camera is blocked or malfunctions.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="warning">
            <p> Lane Keeping Assist, Lane Departure Warning, and Blind Spot Monitoring are designed to support the driver and don't replace the  driver's attention, judgment, and need to control the vehicle. You're still required to keep your hands on the steering wheel at all times, even with these features turned on. Visually check that no vehicles are present in your blind spots to safely change lanes.</p>
