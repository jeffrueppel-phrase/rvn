        <h1>Tips and Techniques</h1>
        <div class="danger-nonelectrical">
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>The vehicle should be equipped with all-terrain wheels and tires, a reinforced underbody shield, and front bumper tow hooks when you drive off road on technical terrain. Driving without this equipment increases the risk of vehicle damage that can lead to tire failure, loss of  control, fire, serious injury, or death.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Perform a <a href="post-trip-inspection.htm">post-trip inspection</a> before you return to paved roads and highways. Off&#8209;road driving may cause vehicle damage that can lead to tire failure, loss of control, serious injury, or death.</p>
                </li>

        <p>Use these tips to drive off road safely and efficiently:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Drive as slowly as possible, and as fast as necessary.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Be aware of the vehicle's weight distribution on inclines, and how the angle of slope affects the center of gravity.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Use smooth progressive inputs for accelerator, brake pedal, and steering. Abrupt inputs can cause loss of traction, stability, or momentum.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Choose an approach or path to avoid damage to the vehicle and trail. Use a spotter and hand signals when needed.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Use inertia and momentum carefully. Be aware of the weight of the vehicle and maintain control appropriate to the terrain and surface conditions. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Keep your hands on the steering wheel. Use safe hand positions to maintain control, such as keeping thumbs and fingers on the outside of the wheel and using the push&#8209;and&#8209;slide technique to turn rather than overhanding. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>In mud, drive slowly at a steady pace. Maintain momentum and avoid stopping. If possible, check for hidden obstacles and the mud depth. Limit spinning tires as much as possible; however, sometimes some spin can aid momentum.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>In deep snow, maintain momentum and avoid stopping while climbing up gradients as securing the vehicle can be tricky. Some tire spin can help maintain momentum, but try to avoid excessive spin. Be careful of slopes and obstacles hidden by the snow.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <b>All-Terrain</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Choose <b>All&#8209;Terrain</b> mode for general off-road driving or when you're unsure about which drive mode to choose. It is ideal in most conditions, but not optimized to any surface or situation. For example, choose this mode when you don't know what type of terrain you will encounter. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Reduce tire pressures when wheel slip is likely to occur. See <a href="air-down-tires.htm">Air Down Tires</a>. Ensure tires are inflated to normal pressures before returning to roads and highways.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="KeepWithNext" MadCap:conditions="R1PlatformConditions.R1Peregrine">
            <b>Soft Sand (Performance Dual-Motor, Dual-Motor with All-Terrain package, Tri-Motor, and Quad-Motor only)</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Choose <b>Soft Sand</b> mode in soft, dry sand and sand dunes. Soft Sand optimizes systems such as accelerator pedal response, torque distribution, and traction control.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Reduce tire pressures. See <a href="air-down-tires.htm">Air Down Tires</a>. Ensure tires are inflated to normal pressures before returning to roads and highways.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Use smooth and steady accelerator, brake, and steering inputs. Avoid large and sudden input changes.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Maintain momentum and avoid stopping. Stay afloat and be aware of shifting sand.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Keep turns and acceleration smooth and consistent. Avoid sudden moves or sharp turns.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>If you need to stop, attempt to stop  the vehicle on a downhill, preferably facing forward.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Pull away from a stop using gradual accelerator pedal inputs to avoid spinning the wheels and sinking them in the sand.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="KeepWithNext" MadCap:conditions="R1PlatformConditions.R1Peregrine">
            <b>Rock Crawl (Tri-Motor and Quad-Motor only)</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Choose <b>Rock Crawl</b> mode for negotiating high&#8209;articulation terrain or steep hills. Rock Crawl optimizes the vehicle for very low&#8209;speed driving when precise control and wheel placement are required.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>If traction is a concern, reduce tire pressures. See <a href="air-down-tires.htm">Air Down Tires</a>. Ensure tires are inflated to normal pressures before returning to roads and highways.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Use slow, progressive accelerator pedal inputs when negotiating obstacles. Choose a safe line. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Always increase torque slowly when negotiating steep gradients or obstacles.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Vehicle Hold, in addition to using the brake pedal, can help prevent the vehicle from rolling backwards when you climb steep gradients or obstacles. It may help to turn off Vehicle Hold when driving down hills.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Motor temperatures may rise when the vehicle climbs tall obstacles off-road.  If this happens, pause briefly to allow the motors to cool before approaching the next obstacle. This ensures that the vehicle has full power to continue climbing.  </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>If you change the Ride Height setting at any time, ensure that you reset Ride Height to the default as soon as possible. This maintains optimum wheel control and stability for the terrain.</p>
            </li>

            <b>Rally (Performance Dual-Motor, Dual-Motor with All-Terrain package, Tri-Motor, and Quad-Motor only)</b>
        </p>
        <ul style="page-break-inside:avoid;">
            <li>
                <p>Choose <b>Rally</b> mode for off-road driving when you want the vehicle to feel less restricted. Rally reduces system control over the vehicle. Take care to drive within your capabilities.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Don't use Rally in or near sensitive areas where <a href="tread-lightly-principles.htm">Tread Lightly! principles</a> are required.</p>

            <b>Drift (Tri-Motor and Quad-Motor only)</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Choose <b>Drift</b> mode to slide the vehicle around in off&#8209;road environments such as snow, dirt, or sand. Drift shifts power rearward, turns off stability control, and reduces traction control. Take care to drive within your capabilities.</p>
            </li>
