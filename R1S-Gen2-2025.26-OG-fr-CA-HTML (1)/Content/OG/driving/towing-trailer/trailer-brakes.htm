        <h1>Trailer Brakes</h1>
        <p>The vehicle supports electric trailer brakes. Support for additional braking systems will be available in a future update. </p>
        <p>When the brake pedal is depressed, the trailer brakes are actuated proportional to the gain setting and brake pressure applied.</p>
        <h2>Trailer Brake Gain</h2>
        <p>When you connect a trailer that has electric trailer brakes, go to <b>Drive Modes</b> &gt; <b>Trailers</b> &gt; <b>Trailer Brake Gain</b>. Set the Trailer Brake Gain appropriate for your trailer, driving conditions, and terrain. </p>
        <p>Before you tow, test the trailer brakes and adjust the gain if necessary. You can also use the Manual Trailer Brake to check the trailer brake function. </p>
        <p>Change the Trailer Brake Gain when the surface conditions change.</p>
        <div class="note">
            <p>Trailer Brake Gain is only available on trailers with trailer brakes. If you connect a trailer equipped with lights only, the Trailer Brake Gain control is off.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Manual Trailer Brakes</h2>
        <p>When towing a trailer with electric trailer brakes, you can apply the trailer brakes independent of the vehicle brakes. Press and hold the right thumbwheel to apply the trailer brakes. The trailer brake pressure  gradually increases to the maximum set gain value.</p>

        <div class="note">
            <p>The Manual Trailer Brake only applies the brakes to the trailer, not the vehicle.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Vehicle Hold</h2>
        <p style="page-break-inside:avoid;margin-bottom: -10pt;">Vehicle Hold is available while towing, but is limited on extreme grades. If Vehicle Hold can't keep the vehicle and trailer from rolling, the vehicle automatically shifts to <b>P</b> (Park). Always be ready to take control in extreme situations.</p>
