        <p>Choose a drive mode based on the road conditions where you will be towing a trailer. The following drive modes are available and optimized to help you tow a trailer safely. </p>

        <p>Choose a towing <a href="../drive-modes/ride-height.htm">ride height</a> when you prepare and load the trailer to ensure weight distribution is maintained. Changing the ride height while towing a trailer affects the loading conditions and can impact handling and stability, especially at higher speeds or on slippery surfaces.</p>

        <p>Trailer Profiles track the trailer's range impact, estimated trailer weight, efficiency and mileage for up to three trailers. The vehicle switches to the last used profile when a trailer is plugged in.
