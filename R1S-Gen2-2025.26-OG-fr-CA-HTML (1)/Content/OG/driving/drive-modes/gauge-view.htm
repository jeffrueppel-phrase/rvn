        <h2>Motor and Battery Temperature Details</h2>
        <p>Fluctuations in motor temperatures are normal during daily use. Higher motor temperatures most often occur during battery preconditioning (even if the vehicle is not in motion). It is normal for motors to heat up during regenerative braking, especially when the vehicle travels down a steep hill or mountain. It is also normal for motor and battery temperatures to rise while the vehicle is towing at maximum capacity.</p>
        <p>If the battery is too cold, the vehicle uses the motors to heat the battery. The vehicle temporarily reduces power and restores power after you start driving and temperatures rise.</p>
        <p>A notification and status indicator appear on the motor or battery gauges when temperatures are too hot or cold. The Limited Performance status indicator  appears on the driver display when power is limited. When the motor or battery temperature gauge turns red, the vehicle temporarily reduces power to prevent overheating. However, the motors and battery cool down quickly, and the vehicle automatically restores power. </p>
        <p>Motor temperatures may rise when the vehicle climbs tall obstacles off-road.  If this happens, pause briefly to allow the motors to cool before approaching the next obstacle. This ensures that the vehicle has full power to continue climbing.</p>
