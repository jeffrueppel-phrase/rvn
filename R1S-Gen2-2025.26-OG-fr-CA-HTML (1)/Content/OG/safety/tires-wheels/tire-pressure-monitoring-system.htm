        <p MadCap:conditions="RegulatoryConditions.HomologatedContent">Each tire, including the spare (if provided), should be checked monthly when cold and inflated to the inflation pressure recommended by the vehicle manufacturer on the vehicle placard or tire inflation pressure label. (If your vehicle has tires of a different size than the size indicated on the vehicle placard or tire inflation pressure label, you should determine the proper tire inflation pressure for those tires.)</p>
        <p MadCap:conditions="RegulatoryConditions.HomologatedContent">As an added safety feature, your vehicle has been equipped with a Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS) that illuminates a low tire pressure telltale when one or more of your tires is significantly under-inflated. </p>
        <p MadCap:conditions="RegulatoryConditions.HomologatedContent">Accordingly, when the low tire pressure telltale illuminates, you should stop and check your tires as soon as possible, and inflate them to the proper pressure. </p>
        <p MadCap:conditions="RegulatoryConditions.HomologatedContent">Driving on a significantly under-inflated tire causes the tire to overheat and can lead to tire failure. Under-inflation also reduces fuel efficiency and tire tread life, and may affect the vehicle's handling and stopping ability.</p>
        <div class="note" MadCap:conditions="RegulatoryConditions.HomologatedContent">
            <p>The TPMS is not a substitute for proper tire maintenance, and it is the driver's responsibility to maintain correct tire pressure, even if under-inflation has not reached the level to trigger illumination of the TPMS low tire pressure telltale.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>TPMS&#160;Malfunction Indicator</h2>
        <p MadCap:conditions="RegulatoryConditions.HomologatedContent">Your vehicle has also been equipped with a TPMS malfunction indicator to indicate when the system is not operating properly. The TPMS malfunction indicator is combined with the low tire pressure telltale. When the system detects a malfunction, the telltale will flash for approximately one minute and then remain continuously illuminated. This sequence will continue upon subsequent vehicle start-ups as long as the malfunction exists.</p>
        <p MadCap:conditions="RegulatoryConditions.HomologatedContent">When the malfunction indicator is illuminated, the system may not be able to detect or signal low tire pressure as intended. TPMS malfunctions may occur for a variety of reasons, including the installation of replacement or alternate tires or wheels on the vehicle that prevent the TPMS from functioning properly. Always check the TPMS malfunction telltale after replacing one or more tires or wheels on your vehicle to ensure that the replacement or alternate tires and wheels allow the TPMS to continue to function properly.</p>
        <h2>TPMS&#160;Sensor Automatic Learning Process</h2>
        <p>The vehicle is equipped with TPMS sensors in the valve stem of each wheel. When you start driving, the sensors automatically connect to the TPMS&#160;module and begin the automatic learning process, which takes less than 10&#160;minutes. After the learning process finishes, the TPMS&#160;sensor transmits the pressure values for each of the front and rear tires to the in&#8209;vehicle displays. </p>
        <h2>Spare Tire TPMS Sensor</h2>
        <p>The full-size spare tire (if equipped) has a TPMS&#160;sensor that remains passive until you install the full-size spare as a driving wheel. After installing the full-size spare tire, you may have to drive for up to 10 minutes to allow the TPMS&#160;sensor to complete the automatic learning&#160;process.</p>
        <p>The compact spare tire (if equipped) doesn't have a TPMS sensor and does not display tire&#160;pressure. </p>
