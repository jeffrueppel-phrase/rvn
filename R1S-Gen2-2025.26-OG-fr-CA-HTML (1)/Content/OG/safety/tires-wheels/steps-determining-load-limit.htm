            <li>
                <p>Locate the statement "The combined weight of occupants and cargo should never exceed XXX kg or XXX lbs" on your vehicle's placard.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Determine the combined weight of the driver and passengers that will be riding in your&#160;vehicle.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p style="mc-short-line-method: tighten;">Subtract the combined weight of the driver and passengers from XXX kg or XXX lbs.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p MadCap:conditions="R1GuideSpecificConditions.OwnersGuide">The resulting figure equals the available amount of cargo and luggage load capacity. For example, if the "XXX" amount equals <MadCap:snippetText src="../../../Resources/Snippets/imperial-metric.flsnp" MadCap:snippetVariables="measure.imperial-value:1\,400,;measure.imperial-unit:lbs,;measure.metric-value:635,;measure.metric-unit:kg," />  and there are five <MadCap:snippetText src="../../../Resources/Snippets/imperial-metric.flsnp" MadCap:snippetVariables="measure.imperial-value:150,;measure.imperial-unit:lb,;measure.metric-value:68,;measure.metric-unit:kg," /> passengers in your vehicle, the available cargo and luggage load capacity is 650 lbs (1400-750 (5 x 150) = 650 lbs) or 295 kg (635-340 (5 x 68) = 295 kg).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Determine the combined weight of luggage and cargo being loaded on the vehicle. That weight may not safely exceed the available cargo and luggage load capacity calculated in&#160;Step 4.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>If your vehicle will be towing a trailer, load from your trailer will be transferred to your vehicle. Consult this manual to determine how this reduces the available cargo and luggage load capacity of your vehicle.</p>
