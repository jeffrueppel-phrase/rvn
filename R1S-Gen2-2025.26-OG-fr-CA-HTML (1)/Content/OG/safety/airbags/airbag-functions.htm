            <p>Passengers, including children, should not lean against or sleep on the side windows or doors, even if they are in a child restraint. The roof rail and side airbags need room to inflate and could cause severe injury or death if passengers are too close to the airbags. Always wear seat belts, even though you have roof rail and side airbags.</p>

                    <p>Don't mount equipment or place objects along the interior headliner or on the vertical pillars near the seat belts. Such objects  may prevent the side or&#160;roof rail airbags from deploying in a severe collision.</p>
