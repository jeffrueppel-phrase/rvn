        <h1 MadCap:conditions="R1GuideSpecificConditions.OwnersGuide">About the Front Passenger Airbag</h1>
        <p>Your vehicle is equipped with an Occupant Classification System (OCS) in the front passenger seat.</p>
        <p>The OCS is an electronic system designed to determine whether the front passenger seat is unoccupied, occupied by a child, or occupied by an adult—and then determine whether the front passenger airbag should be enabled. The purpose is to reduce the risk of injury or death caused by an inflating airbag to a child seated in the front passenger&#160;seat.</p>
        <p MadCap:conditions="R1GuideSpecificConditions.OwnersGuide">If a child is seated in the front passenger seat (with or without a child restraint), the OCS will detect the child and deactivate the front passenger airbag. Rivian highly recommends that all children 12 years old and younger be properly restrained in a rear seat. See <a href="children-rear-seats.htm">Children in Rear Seats</a>.</p>
        <p MadCap:conditions="R1GuideSpecificConditions.OwnersGuide">Adult occupants properly seated in the front passenger seat should not cause the OCS to deactivate the front passenger airbag. However, for smaller adult occupants, the OCS may deactivate the front passenger airbag if the occupant does not sit properly (for example, by not sitting upright, by sitting on the edge of the seat, or by otherwise being out of position). See <a href="proper-sitting.htm">Proper Sitting Positions</a>. Always ensure that you and all vehicle occupants are properly seated and belted.</p>
