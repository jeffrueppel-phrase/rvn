        <h1>Deployed Airbags</h1>
        <p class="caution">You won't be able to drive the vehicle after airbags are deployed or if the vehicle has been in a severe rear crash. An internal safety device automatically shuts off the high&#8209;voltage system when the airbags deploy. The vehicle will need to be towed to a repair shop and then repaired to drivable condition.</p>
        <div class="note">
            <p>The vehicle has a roof rail airbag on both the driver side and passenger side. The roof rail airbag deploys during certain front or side crashes, or when the rollover sensor predicts a near-rollover or rollover accident. If a front or roof rail airbag deploys, the <b>Airbag Malfunction</b> indicator <MadCap:snippetText class="image-online-inline" src="../../../Resources/Images/Icons/inline/ttales_seatbelt_airbag/ic_telltales_seatbelt_and_airbag_airbag_20_unselected.flsnp" /><img class="image-inline-day" src="../../../Resources/Images/Icons/day/status-indicators-v05-airbags-inline-day.svg" alt="Airbag Malfunction icon" MadCap:conditions="OutputTypeConditions.Web" /><img src="../../../Resources/Images/Icons/night/status-indicators-v05-airbags-inline-night.svg" alt="Airbag Mafunction icon" class="image-inline-night" MadCap:conditions="OutputTypeConditions.Web" /> lights up in the driver display. <a href="../../customer-service/customer-service.htm">Contact Rivian</a> to have the vehicle serviced.</p>

            <p>Some airbag system components, such as inflators, may be hot after airbags deploy. To reduce the risk of injury, don't touch the airbag system components after they inflate.</p>
