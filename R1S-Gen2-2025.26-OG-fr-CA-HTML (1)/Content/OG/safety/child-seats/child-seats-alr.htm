        <h1>Automatic Locking Retractor (ALR)</h1>
        <p>The Automatic Locking Retractor (ALR) causes the seat belt to lock when pulled very quickly. ALR can be used to secure a child seat.</p>
        <h2>Activate ALR</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Draw out the seat belt completely.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Retract the seat belt to the desired length to activate locking the seat belt in that position. Once locked, the seat belt cannot be extended further. </p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Cancel ALR</h2>
        <p>Restore the seat belt to normal function by unbuckling and retracting the seat belt fully. Cancel ALR when removing a child seat.</p>
        <div class="note">
            <p class="tight-paragraph">ALRs are different from Emergency Locking Retractors (ELRs), which are designed to allow occupants to move freely once the seat belt is buckled, but lock up in the event of an accident. ALRs are only equipped on passenger seats.</p>
