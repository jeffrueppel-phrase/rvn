        <h1>Tire Replacement</h1>
        <p>For safety and maximum tire performance, replace your tires when they become worn. Driving with worn tires substantially increases the risk of an accident in reduced traction conditions, such as rain or snow.</p>
        <p>Tire wear reduces the tread depth. Your vehicle's tires are equipped with tread wear indicators at <MadCap:snippetText src="../../../Resources/Snippets/imperial-metric.flsnp" MadCap:snippetVariables="measure.imperial-unit:in,;measure.imperial-value:2/32,;measure.metric-unit:mm,;measure.metric-value:1.6," />. </p>

        <p>For safety, inspect your tires regularly and replace them before the tread wear indicators appear at the surface as a solid line. </p>

        <p MadCap:conditions="R1GuideSpecificConditions.OwnersGuide">Always <a href="../../safety/tires-wheels/tire-pressure-care.htm">keep your tires properly inflated</a> for even tread wear and maximum traction. </p>
        <p MadCap:conditions="R1GuideSpecificConditions.OwnersGuide">Be sure to <a href="rotate-tires.htm">rotate your tires</a> every <MadCap:snippetText src="../../../Resources/Snippets/imperial-metric.flsnp" MadCap:snippetVariables="measure.imperial-value:7\,500,;measure.imperial-unit:mi,;measure.metric-value:12\,000,;measure.metric-unit:km," /> to ensure even tread wear and to extend tire life.</p>

            <p>Rivian recommends that the tire tread depth difference between the left and right tires on each axle not exceed <MadCap:snippetText src="../../../Resources/Snippets/imperial-metric.flsnp" MadCap:snippetVariables="measure.imperial-unit:in,;measure.imperial-value:2/32,;measure.metric-unit:mm,;measure.metric-value:1.6," /> maximum. If the difference exceeds the maximum, you may be required to replace both tires on the same axle at the same time. If you're replacing only the front tires, and all tires on the vehicle have the same dimensions, move the rear ones forward, and install new tires on the rear axle. When replacing a tire with a staggered setup (different tire sizes on each axle), ensure that the replacement tire matches the correct specification for that axle.</p>
            <p>Follow your local regulations for tread wear limits.</p>
            <p>Tires should be replaced six years after their date of manufacture due to aging and degradation (regardless of tread depth). Check the US DOT&#160;tire identification number on the <a href="../../safety/tires-wheels/tire-markings.htm">tire marking</a>. The last four numbers indicate the date the tire was manufactured. The first two numbers are the calendar week and the last two are the year.<br /></p>
