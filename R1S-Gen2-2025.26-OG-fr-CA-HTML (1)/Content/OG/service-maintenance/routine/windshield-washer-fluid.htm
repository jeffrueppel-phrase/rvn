        <h2 class="KeepWithNext">Seasonality and Temperature Rating</h2>
        <p class="KeepWithNext">When you refill windshield washer fluid, use fluid rated for the season and temperature range where the vehicle is located. Ensure that you dilute concentrated formulas. Always refer to the temperature rating and instructions on the fluid bottle before you purchase or use windshield washer fluid.</p>
        <div class="important">
            <p>Windshield washer fluid ratings vary. Cold weather–rated fluid performs best in colder temperatures, but is unnecessary in milder temperatures.</p>
            <p>Windshield washer fluid rated for milder temperatures typically contains much lower levels of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). VOCs contribute to ozone levels and smog, particularly when VOCs evaporate in warmer temperatures. Use of cold weather–rated fluid when the temperature is warmer can release higher levels of VOCs into the air. To avoid releasing excess VOCs, use fluid rated for your current season and temperature.</p>
