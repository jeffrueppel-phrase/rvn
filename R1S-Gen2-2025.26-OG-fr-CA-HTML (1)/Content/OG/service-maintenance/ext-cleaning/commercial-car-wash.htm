        <h1>Commercial Car Wash</h1>
        <p class="KeepWithNext">You can use standard car wash services to clean the vehicle. Ensure that you observe any rules posted by the car wash, and that the vehicle's windows are fully up and side mirrors are folded in before entering the car wash. If you haven't turned on Car Wash mode, lock the vehicle to prevent the charge port door from opening. </p>
        <p>For "touchless" car washes where you're not required to drive on a rail, put the vehicle in <b>P</b> (Park).</p>
        <p>For car washes where you're required to drive on a rail, do the following:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>From a <b>P</b> (Park) position, turn on Car Wash mode.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <div class="important">
            <p>If <a href="../../driving/driving-controls/vehicle-hold.htm">Vehicle Hold</a> engages while in <b>N</b> (Neutral), press the brake pedal to release Hold.</p>
        </div>
        <ol MadCap:continue="true">
            <li>
                <p>Put the vehicle in <b>N</b> (Neutral) by using the drive stalk or choosing the on-screen button to Shift To Neutral.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <div class="caution">
            <p>When Car Wash mode is on and you are in <b>N</b> (Neutral), your vehicle will stay in <b>N</b> (Neutral) even if you leave the driver seat. The vehicle will not go into Hold or <b>P</b> (Park). Be cautious when using Car Wash mode in <b>N</b> (Neutral), and only use this mode on flat ground to prevent the vehicle from rolling.</p>
